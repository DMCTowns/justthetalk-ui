# JUSTtheTalk - UI

This is the UI component of the JUSTtheTalk Discussion Forum. It is written using React/NextJS/Redux with Cypress for testing.

## Current Status
The application is more or less feature complete. There are some admin features still under active development. A beta version is running on https://beta.justthetalk.com.

There is some refactoring to be done. Some components need breaking down into smaller components.

Test coverage needs to be improved.
