            Our site principles
          </Typography>
          <p>
            JUSTtheTalk relies on users to make it an enjoyable and interesting place for everyone. We want everyone to
            demonstrate and share intelligence, wisdom and humour and take responsibility for the quality of the
            conversations. Help make the site an intelligent place for discussion, and it will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            JUSTtheTalk follows these principles to keep a positive atmosphere and to promote constructive discussion:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect other posters and their views, opinions and beliefs, and consider your impact on others</li>
            <li>
              Do not be discriminatory on the basis of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief,
              sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership and pregnancy and maternity
            </li>
            <li>
              Recognise the difference between criticising a particular government, organisation, community or belief
              and attacking individuals
            </li>
            <li>Maintain a reasonable tone even in unreasonable circumstances</li>
            <li>Keep it relevant and try not to veer too far off-topic</li>
            <li>
              Stay safe and never post personal and/or identifying information about yourself, family members, your
              place of work, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand that the conversation belongs to everybody so make the admin team aware of potential problems
            </li>
            <li>Help each other to keep conversations inviting and appropriate.</li>
          </ul>

            Usernames
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can register under any name you want, providing that name is not offensive or an attempt to mimic
              another user
            </li>
            <li>
              Please be aware of personal safety when registering - we strongly discourage using an ID or email that is
              identifiable as your real world self
            </li>
            <li>
              It is not possible to change your username and keep the same posting account – in order to change you must
              re-register with a different email address
            </li>
            <li>
              Sockpuppet accounts are not prohibited as a general policy; however you cannot create a sockpuppet if you
              are banned or to avoid a sanction.
            </li>

            Posting guidelines
          </Typography>
          <p>Anyone can start a thread anywhere on the site; however we ask that you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>start the thread in an appropriate folder</li>
            <li>check that there isn’t already a thread that covers the topic – avoid duplication</li>
            <li>don’t start the same thread in several folders</li>
            <li>
              try to make the title descriptive of the content; ‘Hey, look at what’s happened!’ is not a useful title
            </li>
            <li>keep thread headers reasonably short</li>
            <li>use links in the thread header, rather than a lot of copied text.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your posts should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>be accurate (where they state facts)</li>
            <li>be genuinely held (where they state opinions)</li>
            <li>be civil and respectful.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When posting, all comments you make should follow the site principles. This means you should not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>promote violence or be gratuitously violent</li>
            <li>be pornographic, sexually explicit, obscene or lewd</li>
            <li>
              be discriminatory or abusive:
              <ul>
                <li>we do not tolerate racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia or hate-speech</li>
                <li>
                  we don’t allow discrimination, name-calling or insults based on the protected characteristics of the
                  UK Equality Act 2010 e.g. age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual
                  orientation, marriage and civil partnership and pregnancy and maternity
                </li>
                <li>
                  we consider disparaging people’s mental health and using terms suggesting mental disability as abuse
                </li>
                <li>we have a specific policy on discussions around gender identity and sex</li>
                <li>we will not tolerate cyber-bullying</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>impersonate any person or organisation or misrepresent your identity</li>
            <li>promote any commercial activity or venture, including spamming links and/or advertising</li>
            <li>spam the same comment across numerous threads.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All comments you make should also be civil and respectful. This means you should not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>make personal attacks on other posters or their family members</li>
            <li>post mindless abuse</li>
            <li>threaten other posters or the site</li>
            <li>
              post posters’ names, personal information, information about another poster’s family or employer, or other
              information that could identify them
            </li>
            <li>troll persistently, including baiting other posters</li>
            <li>engage in harassment, or continue arguments or old feuds across threads</li>
            <li>denounce trolls or suspected sock-puppets of banned users in-thread</li>
            <li>criticise other posters for reporting, or suspected reporting, of posts</li>
            <li>publicly name or identify the admins of the site, regardless of accuracy.</li>
          </ul>

            Keeping legal when posting
          </Typography>
          <p>
            Your posts must comply with applicable law in the EU and in the country that you’re posting from, and must
            not:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              infringe any copyright, database right, trade mark or any other intellectual property, registered design,
              confidentiality or privacy rights of any person or organisation
            </li>
            <li>be libellous or defamatory</li>
            <li>
              be in contempt of court (i.e. your contribution must not contain anything that risks prejudicing current
              or forthcoming court proceedings, or be in breach of any injunctions, superinjunctions or NDAs)
            </li>
            <li>
              abuse another poster’s anonymity, by deliberate and malicious gathering and use of personal information
            </li>
            <li>
              contain unlawful material (i.e. that condones or encourages unlawful acts or encourages others to do so,
              hacks or causes technical disruption to online services or describes how to conduct an unlawful act)
            </li>
            <li>
              include a link to a website that contains, or directly links to, material that contravenes any of these
              standards
            </li>
            <li>otherwise violate any law.</li>

            Reporting posts and getting in touch
          </Typography>

          <p>The admin team does not monitor threads proactively.</p>
          <p>If you feel that a post is against the community standards or terms and conditions, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ignore it</li>
            <li>
              use the report function to let the admin team know - with enough information to let the team know what the
              issue is if it is not obvious.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you have wider concerns about a user's behaviour or pattern of posting you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ignore that poster using the ignore function</li>
            <li>report the post with further information.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you make a report, please do so promptly, and without engaging in threats or other escalation with other
            posters first.
          </p>
          <p>
            To contact the admins, email <a href="mailto:help@justthetalk.co.uk">help@justthetalk.co.uk</a>

            What happens to a reported post

          <p>If you report a post:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you receive email notification that your report has been received</li>
            <li>admins review your report, as quickly as possible</li>
            <li>a majority of two from three admins make a decision on the report</li>
            <li>admins take action (see below)</li>
            <li>you will not be notified of action taken</li>
            <li>admins may occasionally make a comment in-thread about the action, when necessary.</li>

            Admin action on reported posts
          </Typography>
          <p>Admins can take several actions if we find that a post and/or poster has broken guidelines.</p>
          <p>
            We can’t edit user posts to change the meaning, spelling, or anything else. This means that even if only
            part of a post breaches the community standards, the whole thing may be removed.
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes we also delete subsequent posts which references or quotes from an original (removed) post.</p>

          <p>Sanctions can be applied, depending on the severity and frequency of offences:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>deleting a post</li>
            <li>blocking a user from a particular thread</li>
            <li>automatically reviewing a user’s posts</li>
            <li>imposing a ban from posting, temporary or permanent</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If we do take action against a poster, we do not enter into discussion of that action after the fact. The
            administrators' decision is final.
          </p>

          <Typography
            variant="h6"
            color="textSecondary"
            gutterBottom>
            Other moderation principles and actions
          </Typography>
          <p>General</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Administration decisions are taken after discussion, except in urgent circumstances</li>
            <li>No decision is taken without the agreement of at least two of three admins (from a larger team)</li>
            <li>
              In emergencies, such as when a post may present a risk of legal liability, a single admin may take action
            </li>
            <li>
              Because admins discuss and agree on actions, it can sometimes take up to 48 hours before anything happens.
              Please be patient.
            </li>
            <li>If a report is from or about an admin, they do not take any part in the moderation</li>
            <li>
              Where a series of reports requires admins to consider patterns of behaviour and scrutinise context, this
              will take longer than looking at an individual post, and action may not be immediate
            </li>
            <li>
              We aim to provide notice and warnings of user sanctions by email, however this doesn’t always happen. In
              the email, we will state how long any sanction will last
            </li>
            <li>
              We may extend the length of sanctions if a user attempts to avoid them, for instance by the use of a
              sockpuppet
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a small team of volunteer admins, who are also JtT users. It is JtT policy that admins retain
              their anonymity
            </li>
            <li>
              In line with the Data Protection Act, admin discussions are not held for longer than the period necessary
              to allow decisions to be taken and recent decisions reviewed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>User accounts</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Admins can refuse to register a username at their discretion, particularly if it is offensive or an
              attempt to mimic another user
            </li>
            <li>
              JtT does allow the use of sockpuppet accounts as a general policy, but sometimes we may restrict a user to
              posting from a single account, either temporarily or permanently
            </li>
            <li>
              JtT has the right to modify or delete any or all information relating to a user, including deletion of a
              user’s account without prior notice or reason
            </li>
            <li>Any banning of a user is binding and the decision final</li>
            <li>
              We are reluctant to do so, but we will consider requests from a user for the 'locking' of their account,
              effectively preventing them from posting further
            </li>
            <li>
              In exceptional circumstances, where a user would otherwise be demonstrably at personal risk, we will
              consider requests to delete all posts made by a particular user.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Threads</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A thread may be deleted, where the original premise, content, or a significant number of posts break the
              guidelines or terms and conditions. In most cases we prefer to lock a thread, rather than delete, if
              possible
            </li>
            <li>
              Where an active thread already exists on a subject, we may decide to close any duplicate threads and ask
              posters to continue on the original or more active thread.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Anonymity</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All posters have a right to anonymity, and we will not pass on your email address or other details to any
              third party, except in the cases below
            </li>
            <li>
              If a poster takes malicious real-world action against another poster, including harassment, we will
              cooperate fully with any action that is brought
            </li>
            <li>
              A post which contains evidence of criminal activity may be reported to the relevant authorities, and we
              will cooperate if required to by relevant law enforcement authorities.
            </li>
          </ul>
