          <p>
            JUSTtheTalk is operated on a not for profit basis for the benefit of its community of users. While both I
            and the admin teams freely give our time to keep the site up and running, it is not without costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular the site runs on a dedicated server which incurs a monthly charge. Without your support it
            would not be possible to keep the site up and running.
          </p>

            variant="h6"

            How you can help
          </Typography>
          <p>
            JUSTtheTalk always has been and always will be free to use. We will never use adverts to generate revenue.
            Don't worry if you can't afford to make a donation and in any case, all donations are anonymous. There is no
            recommended amount, just whatever you are able to donate and whatever you think is fair.
          </p>
          <p>You can make either a one off or regular donations via Paypal using the button below.</p>
