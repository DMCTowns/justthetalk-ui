          <p>Welcome to JUSTthetalk.</p>
          <p>
            This page is about the practicalities of navigating and posting on the site, and  what to do if you have a
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of JUSTtheTalk is to promote discussion of the issues of the day. We support free speech, even for
            people we don't agree with or like. We don't support hatred or discrimination.  Please read  our{' '}

              <a>Terms and Conditions</a>
            </Link>{' '}
            before posting.  By posting on the site, you agree to abide by these.

            Getting around the board
          </Typography>
          <p>The board is organised into topic folders and discussion threads that are created within these topics.</p>

          <p>
            The front page lists the recent discussions in all topics. Specific topics can be selected from the list on
            the right-hand side of the front page, or from a drop-down list on mobile devices (☰ button).
          </p>

          <p>
            The list of topics in any folder is normally listed by activity, with the most active topics at the top. You
            can change this list to alphabetical by changing the relevant option on your profile page.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will see several links to the home page and to the current topic folder when you are reading a thread -
            at the top left, and under the last post. There is also an extra link to the home page on the top right.
          </p>

          <p>View a discussion by clicking on its title either on the front page or in a topic folder.</p>

          <p>
            On a discussion thread you can take several actions to move about within that discussion: Previous, Next,
            Top, Bottom, Unread. These are displayed at the top and  bottom of every discussion page. You can also
            navigate through a discussion using the ‘Page’ button to choose a specific page.
          </p>

            Subscriptions
          </Typography>
          <p>
            You can subscribe to individual discussion threads or whole topic  folders by clicking on the relevant links
            on the left hand side of the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you have subscribed, clicking on the 'Subscriptions' link under tools on the right hand side of the
            page will display  unread comments in discussions you have subscribed to. You can also click on ‘Check
            Subscriptions’ at the end of any discussion page.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you subscribe to a folder you will receive all unread comments in all discussions in that folder,
            including new ones as they are created.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can unsubscribe from individual discussions at any time, even if you have subscribed to the folder as a
            whole.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            If there are no more unread posts then you will be directed to a list of your current subscriptions. This
            list is also available on your profile page.

          <p>It is also possible to search specific bits of a post. For example:</p>

            There are lots of in-jokes on JUSTtheTalk; don't worry, you'll soon pick them up. If you're new to the board
            then it pays to spend some time getting to know the place before diving in. Don't be intimidated by other
            posters - they're no better than you - so be prepared to give as good as you get (but please don't resort to
            ad hominem attacks).
          </p>

          <p>
            In the top right hand corner of each comment is a grey square with a downward pointing arrow. Click on this
            to reveal options for each post.
          </p>
          <p>Edit: you can edit your comments up to 30 minutes after you post them.</p>
          <p>Delete: you can delete your post at any time.</p>
          <p>
            You can also share your posts on Facebook or tweet them on Twitter ( once you have set this up via your
            profile page, see below).

            Formatting your posts
          </Typography>
          <p>
            You can add formatting to your posts by putting a special character at the beginning of a line of text
            followed by a space and then your text. The codes are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.noMarker}>
            <li>&gt; - quoted/small text</li>
            <li>b - bold text</li>
            <li>i - italic text</li>
            <li>u - underlined text</li>
            <li>c - centered text</li>
            <li>* - bulleted text</li>
            <li>| - spoiler (the text you put on this line will be hidden in a clickable box)</li>
            <li>] - indented text, multiple characters gives multiple indents</li>
            <li>} - force the line to be a paragraph without a blank line following (good for limericks)</li>
            <li>` - quoted text</li>
          </ul>

            Problems with other posters
          </Typography>
          <p>
            It's a sad fact that sometimes discussions get overheated and posters resort to abuse when they can't win
            their point by other means. This is a site for adults and the expectation is that you will be able to deal
            with these situations yourself. In the first instance simply do not respond; chances is are they will get
            bored and move on.
          </p>
          <p>If this is not  a satisfactory solution,  then you can "ignore" the poster concerned.</p>

            Ignore a Poster
          </Typography>
          <p>
            You can do this by either visiting  the poster's profile page by clicking on their name on any of their
            posts, or by clicking the down arrow on the right of their post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ignored posters are listed on your profile page and you can remove them from the list whenever you like.

            How to Report a Post
          </Typography>
          <p>
            Because we do not actively moderate, we rely on users  to bring to our attention any posts which break the
            guidelines. We have tried to make it as simple as possible to make a report:
          </p>
          <p>To the left of each post is a dropdown button (grey square with a black triangle). </p>
          <p>Click on this button and select the 'Report' menu option. </p>
          <p>
            You will be taken to a page where you can provide your username and  e-mail address and outline the nature
            of your complaint.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Please ensure you explain the reason you’ve reported a post, and why you think it breaches the guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>Complete and submit the form.</p>

          <p>
            We aim to respond to all reports within 48 hours. It is not necessary to be logged into the site to report a
            post.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you report a post, you will receive notification that your report has been received, but you will not be
            notified of action taken.
